# PySub-Interpreter
An in-progress interpreter for PySub, a subset of the Python programming language. Currently the interface has implementation for reading and tokenizing PySub files via lexical analyzer, as well as basic expression evaluation for positive integers. This project is an in-progress assignment for CSCI 230 Programming Languages.

The grammar of the PySub language is described in Backus-Naur Form in BNF.md. It's a very basic language that was made up for the purposes of this assignment; it exists to ease the difficulty of building an interpreter for a programming language in the span of a semester.

All relevant files of the interpreter are included above. All of said files are my own work.
